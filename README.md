>> The dataset has some missing data with a '?' mark put on the missing place 
>> '?' has been replaced with an outlier 
>> The first column, which is actually ID of patients, has been dropped because it doesn't play any role in the network. It only messes up the network accuracy 
>> The last column is the class. 2 is mild, 4 is benign
